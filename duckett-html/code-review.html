    <p>Superscript helps you keep track of dates, such as July 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Subscript is useful for chemical compounds and other items, such as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The "hr" tag creates a line between separated items (as opposed to a blank space like with "br"). See directly below for example.</p>
    <hr>
    <blockquote cite="#"><p>Here's a blockquote.</p></blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p>You can also have quotes within text content, for example <q>Blah blah blah,</q> said the cat.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There's even a tag for abbreviations, for example, <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There's also an acronym tag, for example, <acronym title="National Aueronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Cite tag italicizes title names, for example, <cite>A Brief History of Time</cite>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There's also a <dfn>definition</dfn> tag.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The address tag has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of a page. See example below:</p>
    <address>
        <p><a href="mailto: email@email.com">email@email.com</a></p>
        <p>7850 Address Land, Marzipan, MI</p>
    </address>

    <p>You can insert and delete items and communicate that to your readers through tags also. Example: I <del>hate</del> <ins>love</ins> coding.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The s element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant but that should not be deleted. Example: Price, $750. <s>Sale price was $650</s></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the dl element you will usually see pairs of dt and dd elements. Example is below.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Term to be defined</dt>
        <dd>Definition is described here.</dd>
    </dl>

    <hr>
    <p>You can use the title attribute with the img element ot provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image. Example below:</p>
    <img height=300 src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Ann_Arbor_sunset_2018.jpg" alt="The Ann Arbor skyline" title="Ann Arbor's population is over 100,000.">
    <hr>
    <p>Some notes on images.</p>
    <p>Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a jpeg.</p>
    <p>When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is known as flat color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors.</p>
